Vale doesn't ship opinions of its own. It's a framework for enforcing _your_ style: a published guide like Microsoft's or Google's, an in-house set of terms, or both. It's run by teams at AWS, NVIDIA, Microsoft, GitLab, and Red Hat, [among others who publish their configs](https://vale.sh/adopters).

## Why Vale

Most tools see text. Vale sees a document.

- **It parses your markup instead of guessing at it.** Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, HTML, and [every other format](https://docs.vale.sh/formats) go through a real parser. A rule can target headings, lists, or table cells, and code spans, URLs, and fenced blocks are skipped before a rule ever runs. See [Scopes](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/scopes).
- **Your comments are documentation too.** Vale lifts comments and docstrings out of source code with tree-sitter grammars, so a comment marker inside a string literal stays code. The Markdown in a Rust doc comment, or the reStructuredText in a Python docstring, is linted as though it were its own file. See [Code](https://docs.vale.sh/formats/code).
- **It finds prose in files that aren't prose.** A [View](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/views) says where the writing is in an OpenAPI description, a notebook cell, or a commit message, so Vale lints that and passes over the rest.
- **Rules are files, and they read grammar.** [Extension points](https://docs.vale.sh/checks/existence) in YAML run from a token list to part-of-speech patterns, cross-file relationships, readability formulas, and scripts. A rule can [carry its own fix](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/actions), which an editor applies with one keystroke and an agent applies without deciding anything.
- **One binary, nothing alongside it.** Written in Go, with no runtime to install and files linted in parallel. See [the benchmark](https://vale.sh/features/speed) on GitLab's documentation.
- **Private by design.** Nothing leaves your machine: no account, no upload, and no training on your writing.

## Install

| | |
| :-- | :-- |
| **macOS** | `brew install vale` |
| **Windows** | `choco install vale` &nbsp;·&nbsp; `winget install -e --id errata-ai.Vale` |
| **Linux** | `sudo snap install vale` &nbsp;·&nbsp; `sudo pacman -S vale` &nbsp;·&nbsp; `sudo apt install vale` |
| **Docker** | `docker pull jdkato/vale` |
| **Go** | `go install github.com/vale-cli/vale/v3/cmd/vale@latest` |

Every release also ships [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/vale-cli/vale/releases) for each platform. Scoop, MacPorts, FreeBSD ports, conda-forge, the APT archive, and the rest are on the [installation page](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/installation).

## Quickstart

Vale needs a configuration file that says where to keep styles and which to apply. Create one at the root of your project:

```ini
StylesPath = styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion

Packages = Microsoft

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, Microsoft
```

Then download the styles and lint something:

```bash
vale sync
vale README.md
```

The [Quickstart](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/quickstart) walks through each step. To skip the reading, open a chat already pointed at [vale.sh/AGENTS.md](https://vale.sh/AGENTS.md) and have an assistant set it up.

## Styles

A style is a folder of YAML rules. Start from one that's published&mdash;Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, and more are one line in your config away&mdash;and browse them all in the [Package Explorer](https://vale.sh/explorer). Or write your own:

```yaml
# styles/Docs/Terms.yml
extends: substitution
message: "Use '%s' instead of '%s'."
level: error
swap:
  'Vale cli|vale-cli': Vale CLI
```

That's the whole rule. See [Styles](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/styles) for the rest, and [Vale CMS](https://cms.vale.sh) to author a full project&mdash;config, rules, vocabularies, and tests&mdash;in the browser, with the real engine linting live.
