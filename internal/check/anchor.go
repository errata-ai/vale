// anchor converts an alert's block-relative rune span into an absolute byte
// span within the document.
//
// Vale otherwise locates an alert by searching the document for the text it
// matched, and masking that text so the next alert from the same rule finds a
// later occurrence. That copies the whole context per alert, which is the bulk
// of Vale's allocation on a document with many findings -- and it mislocates a
// match that appears more than once or that spans irregular whitespace.
//
// An anchored alert needs none of that: it already says exactly where it is.
//
// Anchoring is skipped unless the block's position is known *and* verifiable.
// Blocks carved out of markup hold text that has been stripped of its markup,
// so their offsets do not address the original document; checking that the
// text really sits where the offset claims is what keeps those out.
