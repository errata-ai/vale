# Vale Docs

This repository houses the documentation for Vale, which is a static site built using a combination of [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/), [Markdata](https://github.com/errata-ai/markdata), and [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).

## Running Locally

You'll need [Python 3.7.0+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv). Then, just enter the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/errata-ai/vale.git
$ cd vale/docs
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
$ mkdocs serve
```

## Linting

We follow 18F's [content guidelines](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/) with the following additions and changes:

* Use standard American English spelling \(e.g., "ize" instead of "ise"\).
* Capitalize "Vale" unless specifically referring to the binary \(in which case it should be in a code span—i.e., `vale`\).
* Use title case for headings.

We also use [`awesome_bot`](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot) to check our links.
